## Directory listing benchmarks

In order to understand how to efficiently perform one of the most common
file system traversal tasks, we compare directory listing
implementations in Go, C, and OCaml using all the common methods at our
disposal. OS X 10.10+ offers a 'bulk' attribute retrieval system call,
`getattrlistbulk`, for reading the same properties from every node in a
directory. We compare this interface to `readdir` and use common
asynchronous programming packages where available.
